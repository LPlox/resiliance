## Break down of the project

# Infographic

In this section there are a title and 3 cards. Here the plan is to have the numbers in the cards update when the database is updated. Normally the infographic section will have 2 cards, but for the special event that's happening another card can be added for more info. Some cards have a blue link icon on the rop right, this indicates that you can click on the card to get to another page.

## Search functionalities

There are 3 options of search functionalities and it depends on how the database is built.

### Filter

For now the 2 main ways to divide the initiatives is with the **Type of initiative** and **Geographic region**. These categories are highlighted in the top left section of search. These filter function are for users that need some guidance on what they can search for.

### Text Search

At the right corner the user can freely search for any keyword of their choice. The words that are set for a match are the words in the title of the initiatives and the description text.

### Tags system

The tags are used to group the remaining keywords used in the excel sheet. The tags are used to get initiatives that do similar projects, but they are not bound my one specific area. The tags are the third option for users that need some overview of how they can start their search.

The search function can be used in conjunction to each other.
